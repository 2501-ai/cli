# Cursor Rules for 2501 CLI

## Version Management
When opening a pull request in this CLI repository, always increment the patch version in both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

Example: If current version is `0.2.43`, increment to `0.2.44`.

Files to update:
- `package.json`: Update the `"version"` field
- `package-lock.json`: Update both occurrences of the version (root level and in the packages section)

## Code Style
- Follow existing TypeScript and ESLint conventions
- All axios API calls should use the centralized configuration from `initAxios()` in `src/helpers/api.ts`
- Prefer relative API paths (e.g., `/configurations`) over manually constructed URLs
