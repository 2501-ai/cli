Your AI-powered autonomous agent that codes, interacts with your infrastructure and development workflows.

Whether you're debugging production issues, automating DevOps tasks, or seeking coding assistance, 2501 CLI brings the power of multiple specialized autonomous agents directly to your terminal.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install the CLI:**

```bash
npm install -g @2501-ai/cli
```

2. **Set up your API key:**

- Get your API key at [accounts.2501.ai](https://accounts.2501.ai)
- Configure the CLI:

```bash
@2501 set api_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

3. **Supercharge your terminal:**

```bash
@2501 Implement authentication in my express app
```

## 🤔 Why 2501?

- 🎯 **Unmatched Accuracy**: 96.95% success rate on HumanEval, setting a new industry standard. Check out our [benchmark](https://2501-ai.webflow.io/blog/full-humaneval-benchmark) for more details
- 🧠 **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Unlike single-model solutions, 2501 leverages multiple specialized models
- 🔍 **Context-Aware**: Understands your project structure and coding patterns
- ✅ **Self-Validating**: Eliminates hallucinations through multi-model verification
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient** - Get answers directly in your terminal
- 🛠️ **Workspace Aware** - Understands your project context

## 🧠 How It Works

At the heart of 2501 is an orchestration of multiple of the top-performing models on the market today. Our approach, referenced as MoM (or Mixture of Models) going forward, is designed to maximize the successful execution of coding projects derived from natural language instructions.

With no one-size-fits-all model available, output quality is highly task-dependent. Our approach is to decompose any complex software development requirements into bite-sized tasks that can then be assigned to the most suitable model for resolution.

That’s precisely why the MoM approach shines and 2501’s autonomy does not stop here. On top of that, we continually evaluate the resolution of each task with a second model to improve or fix potential hallucinations.
