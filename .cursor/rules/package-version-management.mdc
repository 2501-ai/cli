## Version Management
When opening a pull request in this CLI repository, always increment the patch version in both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

Example: If current version is `0.2.43`, increment to `0.2.44`.

Files to update:
- `package.json`: Update the `"version"` field
- `package-lock.json`: Update both occurrences of the version (root level and in the packages section)
